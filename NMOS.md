- Body made of silicon with abundance of **+** charge (P)
- *Source* and *Drain* are regions with many **-** charges (N)
- Gate isolated from Body with Oxide Layer (Red layer on drawing)

## How to get current to flow
![[Pasted image 20221213160754.png|400]]
- Think of it like "needing a wire" between source and drain
- Add a voltage on G, making a N-region
	- Only occures above a threshold $V_{th}$
- Connects *D* and *S*, voltage difference makes current flow
