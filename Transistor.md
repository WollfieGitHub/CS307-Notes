For the purpose of [[Introduction to Multiprocessor Architecture]] : It works like a switch :
- on -> current flowing
- off -> no current

The **gate** controls wheter it is on of off
- Applying a voltage at the input -> on
- No voltage at input -> off

-> CMOS : Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor
Consists of 1 [[NMOS]] and 1 PMOS device

Each device has the following:
- Two "terminals" (*Source* and *Drain*)
- One gate which is isolated form *S*/*D*
- A Body which separates *Source* from *Drain*
